# English Words

Module 9 Project: This is a web page where a user can input a word and get a definition of that word (and possibly other information) and the user can find out how that word is used by Shakespeare.

### Use Case

As a non-native English speaker, I would like to visit a pleasant looking modern website where I can input a word and get its definition. After that I can store the word for later consideration. As a native English speaker, I would be interested in detailed information about a chosen word.

### Acceptance Criteria

* With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

   * Use Bootstrap.

    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

    * Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

    * Use at least two server-side APIs 

* Links to an external site..

* Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

* Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

### Process

* The project group agreed on a project to look up the definition of an English word and then pronounce that word, using the APIs https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/ and https://rapidapi.com/voicerss/api/text-to-speech-1/ 
* Steph agreed to set up the GitHub repo and Project, and within the project create the necessary Tasks
* Steph, Jeff and Matt discussed how the changes would be made to the Main repo. We agreed that branches could be used.
* Steph set up the English-Helper repo, to add collaborators to the repo their GitHub user names are required. Steph asked for these in Slack
* Jeff agreed to create mockup page to be presented in Figma
* Steph proposed in Slack that, as a measure of organization, when a developer wants to merge their branch to the main branch, they create a "pull request", and another one of us can accept that pull request.
Dec 20
* Jeff presented his Figma design. The group accepted it overall, and decided to agree on the hero banner later.
* Steph suggested a colourful banner collage. She displayed to the others this along with a carousel made with the images of English symbols. 
* The group split up into two coding groups: front-end (Jeff and Deje) and back-end (Jeff, Hillary and Steph)
Dec 21
* Steph suggested an itemized list of backend tasks.
* Steph also suggested a possible backend workflow.
* It was agreed that completed items go to Testing rather than Done.
* Matt suggested that another pull request be required for the main branch, so that the whole team could consider the pushed up code (if Steph is setting this up, she needs to review and perhaps get assistance from Mohammed again)
Dec 22
* Steph merged her accessibility changes to dev
* Hillary pushed her initiate variables code
* Steph made a pull request for various functions, and providing a work flow
